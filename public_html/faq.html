                                        <div><b>Do I have to be an expert or have background in the field to join Blockchain at Berkeley?</b></div> 
                                        <div>Absolutely not! Blockchain at Berkeley aims to create a tight network of collaborators and educators in the space with any skill sets and any level of blockchain-related proficiency. Our mission is to educate the general public alongside our exciting and innovative projects.</div>

                                        <h3> Cal Students </h3> 

                                        <div><b>What makes Blockchain at Berkeley different from other CS developer clubs?</b></div> 
                                        <div>Blockchain at Berkeley focuses on an entirely new space. Our work and community extends beyond the campus, and while we provide opportunities in education and projects (for consultants and developers), what you get out of it is ultimately up to you. Members become experts in niche areas of blockchain with just a few weeks of self-studying; they are now working on noteworthy projects with many of our connections in the industry. We are working on a certification project with several other leading universities and institutions to set the knowledge standard for the space. As pioneers in the blockchain space, we often are building the first blockchain divisions and projects at companies and organizations. We offer opportunities in internal and external research, education, and consulting. If you have questions about recruitment or volunteering, please contact us at recruitment@blockhain.berkeley.edu.</div>

                                        <div><b>Is Blockchain at Berkeley a campus organization or a non-profit organization run by Cal students?</b><div> 
                                        <div>Both! While we began as an ASUC-sponsored campus organization focused on education, we evolved to offer consulting services to companies from all types of industries. Our non-profit status helps us accomplish our mission beyond the campus.</div>

                                        <div><b>How can I join Blockchain at Berkeley?</b></div> 
                                        <div>For currently enrolled Cal students of any standing, we recruit every semester for consultants and developers to work on internal and external projects. Catch us on Sproul and by Soda, and follow us online for news on recruitment. We also offer a Blockchain Fundamentals DeCal every semester in addition to events and workshops open to the public. </div>

                                        <div><b>Do I have to have a technical background to be recruited by or to join Blockchain at Berkeley?</b></div> 
                                        <div>Not at all! Educating members and building experts is the main focus of Blockchain at Berkeley. While a technical background may come in handy for understanding certain topics or for participating in certain projects, we welcome members from all backgrounds!</div>

                                        <h3> Cal Alums and Non-Cal Students </h3> 

                                        <div><b>Is Blockchain at Berkeley only open to currently enrolled Cal students?</b></div> 
                                        <div>Most Blockchain at Berkeley events are open to anyone who wants to attend. For the sake of maximizing our education’s impact, we try to make all our events and workshops open and accessible to the general public.</div>

                                        <div><b>I heard about the certification program Blockchain at Berkeley is working on? Is that only open to Cal students?</b></div> 
                                        <div>No, in accordance with our mission of accessible education in the space, we’re hoping to offer this certification program to everyone free of charge, but will be launching from our internal contacts first as a pilot. For more information on release or how to participate, please contact education@blockhain.berkeley.edu.</div>

                                        <div><b>As a Cal alum or a non-Cal student, how can I get more involved with Blockchain at Berkeley?</b></div>

                                        <div>We are always interested in hearing new ideas and working on interesting projects.
